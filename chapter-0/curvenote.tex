\section{Introduction}

An important part of undergraduate education in physiology is understanding the musculoskeletal system. This e-book and course is designed to teach students about muscle structure and function in an interactive way that combines theory and practice. Classes with information about muscle anatomy, mechanisms of contraction, and generation of electrical activity in muscle cells are accompanied by experimental practicals that introduce students to the technique of electromyogram (EMG) recording. Through these activities, students learn how to record the electrical activity of their muscles using EMG, and how EMG can be used to investigate aspects of muscle activation, biomechanics, force generation, motor unit recruitment, and muscle fatigue. In addition, computational practicals teach students how to analyze EMG recordings to quantify different elements of muscle activity, introducing and reinforcing important data science skills.

The chapters in this e-book each cover a different experimental or computational practical, complete with complementary theoretical lesson plans (including supplementary slide decks), experimental protocols, analysis code written in Python, and sample data sets for exploration. All materials are publicly available and openly licensed for reuse, both herein and at the following links:

\subsection{How to use this e-book}

This e-book and its contents are designed to be modular in nature such that they can be reused and remixed in a variety of ways. The full suite of materials can be used sequentially to run a complete stand-alone course in muscle physiology and EMG. However, educators could instead use only some of the materials to supplement other course activities, depending on their needs. For example, an educator teaching a physiology course could run just the `EMG Basics' practical (Ch. 1) to reinforce concepts seen in their class regarding electrical activity in muscle. Or, an educator teaching a data science course could use our sample EMG recordings and the `EMG Analysis' practical (Ch. 3) to have their students apply analysis techniques to physiologically relevant data sets. Open licensing of all the materials also means that the materials can be modified as educators see fit. The lesson plans were originally designed with a Biomedical Physics curriculum in mind, but can be adapted to have more of a biological or physiological focus, depending on the intended audience.
