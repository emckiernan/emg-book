# Open-source course in muscle physiology & EMG

## Overview

This e-book is designed to teach students about muscle structure and function in an interactive way that combines theory and practice. Classes with information about muscle anatomy, mechanisms of contraction, and generation of electrical activity in muscle cells are accompanied by experimental practicals that introduce students to the technique of electromyogram (EMG) recording. Through these activities, students learn how to record the electrical activity of their muscles using EMG, and how EMG can be used to investigate aspects of muscle activation, biomechanics, force generation, motor unit recruitment, and muscle fatigue. In addition, computational practicals teach students how to analyze EMG recordings to quantify different elements of muscle activity, introducing and reinforcing important data science skills. 

The chapters in this e-book, which is also available on Curvenote at https://emckiernan.curve.space, each cover a different experimental or computational practical, complete with complementary theoretical lesson plans (including supplementary slide decks), experimental protocols, analysis code written in Python, and sample data sets for exploration. All materials are publicly available and openly licensed for reuse.
